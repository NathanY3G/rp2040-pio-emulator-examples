# Example for the Pimoroni Blinkt! with Unit Test

This is an annotated example which demonstrates one approach to writing unit
tests for PIO programs. The program itself is very primitive and is hard-coded
to set all eight LEDs to a single colour.

Try re-factoring the example but don't forget to check that the tests still
pass!
